The web3 users get their transactions front-run or sandwiched regularly on the Ethereum network. This is because of the way Ethereum works. Once the tx is initiated its goes to the mempool, wherein it gets picked up by miner based on the gas fees. The project demonstrates how to use the flashbots to bypass the Ethereum mempool and send batched transactions at once. The use case discussed is, if a wallet is compromised by the hacker and the victim has tokens that need to be recovered.
